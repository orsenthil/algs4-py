"""
The {@code EdgeWeightedGraph} class represents an edge-weighted
graph of vertices named 0 through <em>V</em> â€“ 1, where each
undirected edge is of type {@link Edge} and has a real-valued weight.
It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph,
iterate over all of the edges incident to a vertex. It also provides
methods for returning the number of vertices <em>V</em> and the number
of edges <em>E</em>. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
By convention, a self-loop <em>v</em>-<em>v</em> appears in the
adjacency list of <em>v</em> twice and contributes two to the degree
of <em>v</em>.
<p>

This implementation uses an adjacency-lists representation, which
is a vertex-indexed array of {@link Bag} objects.
All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except
iterating over the edges incident to a given vertex, which takes
time proportional to the number of such edges.
