"""
The {@code IndexMinPQ} class represents an indexed priority queue of generic keys.
It supports the usual <em>insert</em> and <em>delete-the-minimum</em>
operations, along with <em>delete</em> and <em>change-the-key</em>
methods. In order to let the client refer to keys on the priority queue,
an integer between {@code 0} and {@code maxN - 1}
is associated with each keyâ€”the client uses this integer to specify
which key to delete or change.
It also supports methods for peeking at the minimum key,
testing if the priority queue is empty, and iterating through
the keys.
<p>
This implementation uses a binary heap along with an array to associate
keys with integers in the given range.
The <em>insert</em>, <em>delete-the-minimum</em>, <em>delete</em>,
<em>change-key</em>, <em>decrease-key</em>, and <em>increase-key</em>
operations take logarithmic time.
The <em>is-empty</em>, <em>size</em>, <em>min-index</em>, <em>min-key</em>,
<em>contains</em>, and <em>key-of</em> operations take constant time.
Construction takes time proportional to the specified capacity.
