"""
The {@code IndexMaxPQ} class represents an indexed priority queue of generic keys.
It supports the usual <em>insert</em> and <em>delete-the-maximum</em>
operations, along with <em>delete</em> and <em>change-the-key</em>
methods. In order to let the client refer to items on the priority queue,
an integer between {@code 0} and {@code maxN - 1}
is associated with each keyâ€”the client
uses this integer to specify which key to delete or change.

It also supports methods for peeking at a maximum key,
testing if the priority queue is empty, and iterating through
the keys.
<p>

This implementation uses a binary heap along with an array to associate
keys with integers in the given range.
The <em>insert</em>, <em>delete-the-maximum</em>, <em>delete</em>,
<em>change-key</em>, <em>decrease-key</em>, and <em>increase-key</em>
operations take logarithmic time.

The <em>is-empty</em>, <em>size</em>, <em>max-index</em>, <em>max-key</em>,
<em>contains</em>, and <em>key-of</em> operations take constant time.
Construction takes time proportional to the specified capacity.
